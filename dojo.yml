  This dojo consists of misc topics that interest robwaz, but
  aren't part of the core pwn.college curriculum.

modules:
  - id: intro-to-arm
    name: Introduction to ARM
    description: |
      ARM processors are a competitor to the intel processors most of the dojo focuses on.
      Dominating the mobile computing space, these chips excel at power-efficient processing.
      Recently, ARM processors can also be found in personal computers, with Apple's
      M1 and M2 chips serving as notable examples.

      Unlike amd64, ARM assembly (aarch64) is a RISC architecture with a small number of fast
      instructions.  This module provides a short crash-course to get familiar with some of
      the key differences in aarch64.  Drawing directly from the "Assembly Crash Course" module
      where possible to highlight differences.

          The dojo box CPU is amd64 architecture.  Working with a non-native architecture has its own unique challenges.

          The simplest way to interact with these challenges is with a short pwntools script.
          A template you can use is shown below.

          ```
          #!/usr/bin/env python3
          from pwn import *
          context.arch = 'aarch64'

          asm_bytes = asm("""
            PUT YOUR AARCH64 ASSEMBLY HERE
            """)

          with process('/challenge/run') as p:
            p.send(asm_bytes)
            p.stdin.close()
            p.interactive()
          ```
